I am Nicholas Nagle.  This is not my [NIH Biosketch](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-032.html).

You've probably noticed me in the front of the class.  I'm the one who talks too much and needs a haircut.

I went to graduate school in Santa Barbara.  I wasn't a big fan of the beach.  The water is too cold.  But I do miss the smell of salt and rotting seaweed and the distant sound of foghorns on clear days.  I have my PhD in Geography and a pair of Masters Degrees in Economics and Geography.  I thought that Geography was a little crazy, so I went to Economics.  Then I discovered that I kinda like crazy so I came back.   Hemingway rocks.  But these days, I spend more time reading the Journal of the American Statistical Association than fiction.

I'm pretty jazzed about this semester.  To be honest, I'm not usually over-excited about Intro to Statistics, but I am this year.

I get really animated when someone lets me talk about statistics and my eyes go big and crazy.

When I'm working I completely lose track of time.  I missed my first date with my wife because I was doing my physics homework.  Hand to god.  She is very forgiving.

I have two kids.  When I come home, they run up and give me a hug.  Then they ignore me.  But for that one second... it's pretty cool.


I am not a poet.  I once wrote this pair of haiku:

Fireflies absently
Dance across the twilit road -
Neon splash on glass

Title: Starry Night
Media: Insect on glass
Artist: Volkswagen

But that's all I had in me.  That little bit and then it was done.
