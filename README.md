<<I am Nicholas Nagle.  You've probably noticed me talking in the front of the class.  I went to graduate school in Santa Barbara.  I wasn't a big fan of the beach.  The water is too cold.  But I miss the smell of salt and rotting seaweed and the distant sound of foghorns on clear days.  I have my PhD in Geography and a pair of Masters Degrees in Economics and Geography.  I thought that Geography was a little crazy, so I went to Economics.  Then I discovered that I kinda like crazy so I came back.   Hemingway rocks.  But these days, I spend more time reading the Journal of the American Statistical Association than I do fiction.

I'm pretty excited about this semester.  To be honest, I'm not usually excited about Intro to Statistics, but I am this year.  It's not you.  It's me.

I get really animated when I talk about statistics and my eyes go big and crazy.

I have two kids.  When I come home, they run up and give me a hug.  Then they ignore me.  But for that one second... it's pretty cool.


I am not a poet.  I once wrote this pair of haiku:

Fireflies absently

Dance across the twilit road -

Neon splash on glass



Title: Starry Night

Media: Insect on glass

Artist: Volkswagen

But that's all I had in me.  That little bit and then it was done.
